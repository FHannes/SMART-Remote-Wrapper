SMART-Remote-Wrapper
====================

This SCAR library wraps the SMART remote library in a SCAR compatible format, which allows the end-user to use SMART in conjunction with SCAR Divi.

The SMART library is written by Benjamin J. Land and licensed under GPLv3. The official SMART source code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/BenLand100/SMART

This library is (now) only compatible with a forked version of SMART, which removes support custom library loaders. The fork is available here: https://github.com/FHannes/SMART

SCAR Divi is being developed by Frédéric Hannes and available at: http://www.scar-divi.com
